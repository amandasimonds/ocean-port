# OceanPort

Educational app that engages young audiences in learning about the ocean through videos, reading, and gamification.

Create an OceanPort account, and go to the learning tab. Choose an ocean topic to read and learn about. Then, take a quiz on that topic. If you pass the test, you can give yourself a badge on the badges page. If you log out, and log back in, your badges will still be saved. This lets you keep track of your progress and learning.
